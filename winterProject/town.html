<p>Stowe is a premier four season resort destination particularly reknowned for its alpine and Nordic recreation, mountain biking, hiking and world class spas.  The community comes alive with festivals, shopping and dining opportunities with  activities for everyone in all seasons.   Stowe has made the most out of its natural setting: Mount Mansfield, the forests and fields, clear mountain streams and fine air to carve out an appealing, enduring, distinctively New England style of life.   What makes it truly special is that Stowe is also a place people call home.</p>


<p>Stowe is a town in northern Vermont. It is overlooked by Mount Mansfield, known for its trails and ski slopes. The Auto Toll Road climbs to the summit ridge. Near the base, Smugglers Notch State Park has dense forest and a narrow mountain pass. The Stowe Recreation Path follows the West Branch of the Little River through town, with mountain views. The Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum exhibits ski gear and artifacts.</p>
<p>Stowe is known for its mountainous landscape and outdoor activities, especially skiing and snowboarding. But, Stowe is much more than skiing in winter; there is something to do in winter, no matter your interest or age. Snow or not, the choices are vast!</p>
