<p class="subtitle">Security deposit protection/Security deposit</p>

<p>The Security Deposit Protection plan covers unintentional damages to the Property's interior that occur during your stay, provided they are disclosed to the Agent prior to check-out.   Any damages that exceed the maximum benefit per property or not covered by the insurance company will be deducted from the security deposit, if applicable, or charged to the credit card on file.  If, during your stay at the Property, an insured person causes any damage to real or personal property as a result of inadvertent acts or omissions, the insurer will reimburse the insured for the cost of repair or replacement of such property up to a maximum benefit of that property. Certain terms and conditions apply.  Full details of the Security Deposit Protection coverage are contained in the Certificate of Insurance or Insurance Policy.  The Security Deposit Protection plan can be purchased up to, and including at, check-in.   By submitting payment for this plan, you authorize and request CSA Travel Protection and Insurance Services to pay directly Val Vermont Chalet Rental any amount payable under the terms and conditions of the Security Deposit Protection plan.  Please contact Val Vermont Chalet Rental directly if you do not wish to participate in this plan or assignment.   If the renter does not purchase the Security Deposit Protection, the Renter understands that the Renter is liable for damages, accidental or intentional, to the Property.  Any additional cleaning or maintenance expense due to smoking in the residence, unapproved pets in the residence, key locked in residence, furniture rearranged but not returned to original position, windows left open, not honoring check-out time or any damage caused by negligence or willfull conduct by Renter or Renter's guests will be charged immediately to Renter's credit card.  A set departure cleaning fee has been added to rental fee.  If, however, the property is found to be in disarray upon departure, such as spills or excessive trash or to clean excessive dirt (i.e. stained carpets, furniture, walls, appliances, etc.) additional fees may be charged to restore the unit to its original condition.  If a Security Deposit is provided and the amount is not enough to cover all the damages and costs, you must pay the extra amount, and you authorize us to charge the credit card provided.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Condition use of property</p>

<p>Renter shall use the Property for residential purposes only in a careful manner so as to prevent any damage, injury, deterioration, or loss to the Property. Renter shall prevent any soiling, staining, or damage to carpet, furnishings, floors, woodwork, and walls. Renter shall keep and maintain the Property in good order and repair at all times and in a clean and sanitary condition, free from rubbish and dirt, with prompt and regular removal of trash and garbage.  Any damage, soiling, or other injury to the Property caused or allowed by Renter shall be promptly repaired, cleaned, and restored at Renter's sole expense.  Owner or its agents may enter the property at reasonable times to make repairs or provide maid service. Renter may cook in areas specifically designated for cooking. Renter must immediately notify Owner or agent of fire or other damage to property. Renter shall be liable for all acts of the family, invitees, employees, or other persons invited onto the property. Guest may not sublet or assign this rental agreement. No pets are allowed, unless specified in separate Pet Agreement, addressing the type and number of pets and additional security deposit requirements and precautions required for pets.  Renter will not smoke indoors.  No parties, catering or outside music permitted without prior consent. Additional charges may apply. Renter shall comply with all rules, regulations, and other requirements of any community association or other covenants, conditions, and restrictions that are applicable to the Property.   Use of the Property by Renter and Renter's family members, visitors, and guests shall be at their own risk.  Renter acknowledges and understands that there may be dangerous instrumentalities such as ponds, pools, saunas, hot tubs and decks at the Property, and Renter assumes all risk of injury, damage or death resulting from the use of such dangerous instrumentalities.  Renter shall not make or permit to be made any alterations, additions, improvements, or changes to the Property without in each case first obtaining the written consent of Owner.  At the end of the lease term, Renter shall quit and deliver the Property to Owner in as good condition as it is on the date of this Agreement, ordinary wear and tear excepted.  Agent makes every effort to maintain up-to-date and accurate photos and descriptions of properties.  However, Agent cannot be held responsible if owner has made changes to actual furnishings, equipment and appliances in the property.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Entry and inspection</p>

<p>Agent reserves the right to enter the Property at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice for the pur­poses of inspecting the Property or showing the Property to prospective enters, or other authorized persons.  If Agent has reasonable belief that there is imminent danger to any person or property, Agent may enter the Property without advance notice.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Assignment and subleasing</p>

<p>Renter shall not assign or sublet the Property or permit the use of any portion of the Property by other persons who are not family members or guests of Renter included as permitted occupants under this Agreement.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Risk of loss and indemnification</p>

<p>Renter agrees that all personal property, furnishings, furniture, and personal effects brought into the Property shall be at the sole risk of Renter with regard to any theft, damage, destruction, or other loss and Renter assumes all risk related to use of the Property by Renter and Renter's family members, guests, and invitees. Renter is advised to obtain insurance coverage for Renter's personal property.  Owner and Agent shall not be liable for any damage or injury to Renter, or any other person, or to any property, occurring on the Property, or any part thereof, and Renter agrees to hold Owner and Agent harmless from any losses or claims for damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that arise during Renter's occupancy of the Property, no matter how caused.</p>

<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<p class="subtitle">Hot tubs and other electric appliances</p>

<p>Some of our properties contain hot tubs, saunas, internet access, satellite or cable TV and other appliances.  Agent will not be held responsible for their failure to work.  In the event of a malfunction, please contact the office immediately and we will make every effort to have it repaired as quickly as possible.  Properties with hot tubs are serviced and cleaned on a regular basis by a professional service independent of Owner and Agent.  While every effort has been made to ensure that the water quality is clean and meets all recommended health standards, neither Agent or Owner can guarantee the use of the spa will not have an adverse effect on the person entering the tub.  Accordingly, use of the spa is at your own risk and neither the Agent or Owner will be held responsible for any injury or illness resulting from such use.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Road conditions</p>

<p>The weather in Vermont can be treacherous and volatile at times.  While every effort will be made to plow and sand all properties in a timely manner, Agent does not guarantee your vehicle's ability to access each property 24/7.  We highly recommend snow tires during the winter season and AWD when possible.  Many of our properties require AWD for access.  Please refer to our website for any special requirements.
</p>

<p class="subtitle">Default</p>

<p>If Renter shall fail to comply with and carry out Renter's obligations and responsibilities under this Agreement, Renter shall at once surrender possession of the Property, remove all of Renter's property and belongings therefrom, and leave the Property in good order and repair free of any damage,  soiling, or staining, and clean and free of all rubbish or trash. Agent may re-enter the Property and take all actions to repossess the Property. There shall be no refund of any portion of the rental payment and other charges paid by Renter. Renter acknowledges and confirms that these remedies are reasonable liquidated damages for Renter's failure to carry out Renter's responsibilities under this Agreement. In the event legal action is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the other party for all costs and expenses incurred in any such enforcement means or actions, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

<p class="subtitle">unavaibility of property</p>

<p>In the event the Property is not available for use during the term of the lease due to reasons, events, or circumstances beyond the control of Agent, Agent will apply due diligent good faith efforts to locate a replacement property that equals or exceeds the Property with respect to occupancy capacity, amenities, location, and the like that meets the reasonable satisfaction of Renter. If such replacement property cannot be located and made available to Renter, Agent shall immediately return all payments made by Renter, whereupon this Agreement shall be terminated, and Renter and Agent will have no further obligations or liabilities in any manner pertaining to this Agreement.</p>

<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<p class="subtitle">Destruction of property and eminent domain</p>

<p>In the event the Property is destroyed or rendered untenantable by fire, storm, flood or earthquake, or other casualty not caused by the negligence of Renter, or if the Property is taken by eminent domain, this Agreement shall be terminated from such time, except for the purpose of enforcing rights that may have then accrued under this Agreement.  The rental shall then be accounted for between Owner and Renter up to refunding the rent collected beyond such date.  Should only a part of the Property be destroyed or rendered untenantable by fire, storm, flood, earthquake, or other casualty not caused by the negligence of Renter, the rental shall abate in the proportion that the injured part bears to the whole Property.  The part so destroyed shall be restored by Owner as quickly as practicable, after which the full rent shall recommence and the lease will continue according to its terms.  Any condemnation award concerning the Property shall belong exclusively to the Owner. </p>

<p class="subtitle">Cancellation and refund</p>

<p>If Renter provides written notice of cancellation at least thirty (30) or more days prior to commencement (sixty (60) or more days for Seasonal/Winter Holiday periods) of the lease, Agent shall return all payments made by Renter, less a cancellation fee of 15% of the total Rent.  If written notice of cancellation is received less than the thirty (30) days prior to commencement of the lease (sixty (60) or more days for Seasonal/Winter Holiday periods), Agent shall retain all payments made by Renter.  In the event Agent is able to re-rent the Property to another renter for the same or more rental payment as provided in this Agreement, provided however that Agent shall be under no obligation or expectation to do so, then Agent will return to Renter all payments made by Renter, less the cancellation fee of 15% of total Rent  and any expenses incurred by Agent in re-renting the Property.  Renter acknowledges and confirms that these remedies are reasonable liquidated damages for Renter's failure to carry out Renter's responsibilities under this Agreement.  To protect against cancellations caused by certain unforeseen events, such as illness, death, natural disasters, etc., we recommend that Renters purchase trip cancellation and Interruption Protection insurance to assure refund of deposits paid and reimbursement of other vacation payments, which we offer through CSA Travel and Protection Services.</p>

<p class="subtitle">General provisions</p>

<p>This Agreement contains all understandings and agreements between the parties hereto and may only be amended by written instrument signed by the parties. No failure or forbearance by Agent to enforce compliance by Renter with any provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to demand full and exact compliance by Renter at any later time. Interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Vermont.  Neither party shall be liable in damages or have the right to terminate this agreement for any delay or default in performing hereunder if such delay or default is caused by conditions beyond its control including but not limited to acts of God, government restrictions (including the denial or cancellation of any export of other necessary license), wars, insurrections and/or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the party whose performance is affected (including mechanical, electronic, or communications failure).</p>
